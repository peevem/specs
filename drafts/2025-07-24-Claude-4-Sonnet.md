> This is the main repository for the `PEEVEM Project`. My goal is to create a new way to do personal knowledge management, through text-based event-sourcing, something reliable over decades; easy to understand and to audit. The main idea is to provide a standard way to store all sorts of personal events (from real-life events to trivial things like bookmarking a webpage, moving a file to external drive, creating a contact etc. anything really) with ubiquitous technologies so everyone can interact with it in their own way. With this standard, we could build an ecosystem of tools, for instance, to create events linked to other systems like tweets, reels, mails, contacts, calendar events, devices, anything. The project does not intend to replace existing, specialized tool, but to link everything.

This repository should host those schemas, the specification on how to store and use those events. I would like this project to be community-driven, and there are a few open questions like how to version those schemas or how to describe the several customized events that compose a personal event file.

I'll help you organize the PEEVEM Project repository to create a strong foundation for your personal knowledge management system. Let me analyze what you have so far and suggest a structured approach.Let me help you create a solid starting point for the PEEVEM Project repository. Based on your description, this is a personal knowledge management system based on event sourcing with JSON Schema definitions.

I'll analyze the current state of the project and propose a comprehensive structure.Now I'll create a comprehensive structure for the PEEVEM project. Let me start by improving the README and creating other essential files for the repository.

---

I've created a comprehensive structure for the PEEVEM project that establishes it as a solid foundation for personal event-sourced knowledge management. Here's a summary of what I've set up:

1. **Core Documentation**:
    - Comprehensive README explaining the project's purpose and structure
    - Contributing guidelines
    - Introduction and concept documentation
    - Use cases and implementation guidance

2. **Schema Definition**:
    - Core schema with base properties all events must have
    - Event schema for basic events
    - Content schema for content-related events
    - Specialized schemas for bookmarks and contacts
    - Documentation on schema versioning approach

3. **Examples**:
    - Basic PEEVEM stream examples
    - Digital activity stream examples
    - Life events stream examples
    - README explaining how to use the examples

4. **Project Infrastructure**:
    - GitHub issue and PR templates
    - Package.json with development dependencies
    - Validation scripts for schemas and examples
    - Documentation generation scripts
    - .gitignore file

5. **Community Engagement**:
    - Templates for proposing new schemas
    - Guidelines for contribution
    - Documentation on versioning and backward compatibility

This structure supports your goals by:
- Establishing a clear standard for event storage using JSON Schema
- Providing a foundation for community-driven development
- Creating examples that demonstrate real-world use cases
- Setting up tooling to ensure quality and consistency

For interaction with the project, community members can:
1. Review and use the schemas for their own personal knowledge management
2. Contribute new event type schemas through GitHub PRs
3. Build tools that create, validate, or consume PEEVEM events
4. Suggest improvements or report issues using the templates

As for additional repositories, you might consider:
1. **peevem-tools**: A repository for reference implementations of tools that work with PEEVEM data
2. **peevem-examples**: More extensive real-world examples beyond the basic ones in the specs repo
3. **peevem.org**: A website repository for the project's public-facing documentation
4. **peevem-validator**: A standalone validation tool for PEEVEM streams

This modular approach allows different aspects of the ecosystem to evolve independently while maintaining the core specifications as the authoritative reference.

> Tags should be separate events to allow easy addition or removal without changing original events. Change documentation and examples accordingly.

I'll update the documentation and examples to reflect the concept that tags should be separate events rather than embedded within the original events. This approach allows for more flexible tag management without modifying the original events.

Let me implement these changes

> I would like to package LLM instructions and guidelines for other people to use with any model of any provider. I should I proceed? Is there a standard for this?

Yes, there *is* growing interest in standardizing how LLM instructions and guidelines (also called *system prompts*, *persona files*, or *prompt templates*) are packaged and shared across different models and providers. However, this space is still evolving, and there's no fully universal standard yet.

Hereâ€™s how you can proceed and what standards or best practices you can align with:

---

## âœ… 1. **Define the Purpose of the Instruction Package**

Start by being explicit about what your instruction package is intended for. Some common types:

* **System prompts/personas** â€“ Defining the assistant's behavior
* **Task-specific prompts** â€“ Instructions for summarization, Q\&A, translation, etc.
* **Safety or alignment guidelines** â€“ Restrictions or moderation constraints
* **Multi-turn interaction rules** â€“ For maintaining consistency over conversations

---

## âœ… 2. **Use Existing Formats Where Possible**

While there's no single universal format, some promising standards and conventions are emerging:

### ðŸŸ¦ **OpenPrompt / PromptFormat (Emerging Community Standards)**

* [PromptFormat](https://github.com/prompttools/promptformat) is an initiative to create a **vendor-neutral prompt file format**, supporting structured metadata for prompts.

    * It uses `.json` or `.yaml` with fields like:

      ```yaml
      name: friendly-qa
      description: A prompt for friendly, concise Q&A
      input_variables: ["question"]
      template: >
        You are a helpful assistant. Answer the following question concisely.
        Question: {question}
      ```
    * Itâ€™s interoperable with libraries like LangChain, PromptTools, and LMQL.

---

### ðŸŸ© **LangChain PromptTemplate Format**

* LangChain supports flexible prompt templates with input variables and structured chaining.
* Prompts are often in Python or JSON/YAML configs:

  ```python
  from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
  prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(
      "Translate the following text to French: {text}"
  )
  ```

---

### ðŸŸ¥ **Anthropicâ€™s System Prompts / OpenAIâ€™s ChatML**

* Anthropic: Claude system prompts are often plain text headers.
* OpenAIâ€™s ChatML (used in GPT-4):

  ```json
  [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a polite assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke."}
  ]
  ```

You can design your package to **output prompts in multiple formats** for compatibility.

---

## âœ… 3. **Organize Your Prompt Package**

You can organize your prompt files in a clear structure, e.g.:

```
my-llm-prompts/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ prompts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ summarization.yaml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ polite-assistant.yaml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ coder-mode.json
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ formats/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chatml/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ anthropic/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ huggingface/
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ schema.json  # optional JSON Schema for validation
```

Each prompt file could include:

* `name`, `description`
* `template`
* `input_variables`
* `examples` (optional)
* `target_models` or `compatibility_notes`

---

## âœ… 4. **Include Model Compatibility Metadata**

Different LLMs have different limits or expectations:

* Max tokens (e.g., 4k vs. 32k)
* Role formatting (`system`, `user`, etc.)
* Prompt injection protection (some escape sequences or behaviors)
  Include comments or metadata to indicate compatibility:

```yaml
compatibility:
  openai: true
  anthropic: requires adjustment
  llama3: tested
```

---

## âœ… 5. **Optionally Publish on Community Repositories**

If you want to share widely, consider:

* **PromptHub** (by PromptLayer) â€“ [https://www.prompthub.us/](https://www.prompthub.us/)
* **PromptBase** â€“ marketplace for prompts
* **GitHub** â€“ create a public repo with tags like `prompt-engineering`, `llm-guides`

---

## âœ… 6. **Consider a License and Attribution Policy**

Make clear how others can use your prompt package. Consider:

* Open-source licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0)
* Attribution requirements
* Commercial use policies

---

## âœ… 7. **Optional: Build a Prompt Loader/Converter Tool**

To ease adoption across providers, create a CLI tool or library to:

* Convert between formats (ChatML â†” Anthropic â†” raw string)
* Fill in input variables
* Preview output
* Validate structure

| Step | Action                                         |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Define use case clearly                        |
| 2    | Align with PromptFormat or LangChain templates |
| 3    | Structure prompt files in readable YAML/JSON   |
| 4    | Include model compatibility metadata           |
| 5    | Publish and document usage                     |
| 6    | Choose a clear license                         |
| 7    | Optionally provide tooling                     |

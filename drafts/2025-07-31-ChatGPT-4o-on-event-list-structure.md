# ChatGPT saved this

> is working on a standard for storing personal events in NDJSON files, validated by JSON Schemas. Each file can contain different event types, with logic such as create, update, archive, and delete, and the ability to extend logic per user needs. They aim to build tools that recognize common event types and help maintain indices of active and archived events.


# Response

You're designing a flexible yet structured system‚Äîsmart move to lean on NDJSON and JSON Schema for this. Here's how you can approach the **specification of allowed events** and **handling of logic** tied to them:

---

### üß± 1. **Specify Allowed Events in an Event File**

#### Option A: Use a Manifest File

Include a `manifest.json` (or similar) alongside each NDJSON file, declaring the event types it contains.

```json
{
  "eventTypes": ["create", "archive", "update", "delete"],
  "schemas": {
    "create": "schemas/article-create.schema.json",
    "archive": "schemas/article-archive.schema.json"
  }
}
```

#### Option B: Embed Type Information in Each Event

Each event in the NDJSON could include a `type` field, and tools can validate against a known registry.

```json
{ "type": "create", "data": { "title": "..." } }
{ "type": "archive", "data": { "articleId": "..." } }
```

Tools can match the `type` to a known schema from a global or local registry.

---

### üß† 2. **Handling Logic Tied to Events**

You want to support logic like:

* `create` ‚Üí Adds to index
* `archive` ‚Üí Removes from active index, adds to archive
* `delete` ‚Üí Remove entirely
* `update` ‚Üí Modify existing entry

Here‚Äôs how to model it:

#### Option A: Event Processor Modules

Define a set of "logic modules" per event type, similar to reducers in Redux or transformers in event sourcing:

```js
{
  type: "create",
  process: (state, event) => {
    state.index.push(event.data);
    return state;
  }
}
```

Each user could define their own processors or fall back to common logic provided by your tools.

#### Option B: Registerable Logic Descriptors

A `logic.json` file describes how to treat events:

```json
{
  "create": { "action": "add", "target": "index" },
  "archive": { "action": "move", "from": "index", "to": "archive" },
  "delete": { "action": "remove", "target": "index" }
}
```

Then your tooling interprets these instructions.

### üõ†Ô∏è 3. **Validation via JSON Schema**

Have one schema per event type. Use `$ref` in a parent schema or validate dynamically at runtime:

```json
{
  "oneOf": [
    { "$ref": "schemas/create.schema.json" },
    { "$ref": "schemas/archive.schema.json" }
  ]
}
```

Or use a dynamic validator:

```js
validate(event, schemas[event.type])
```

---

### üîÅ 4. **Extensibility**

Let users:

* Add their own event types and associated schemas
* Register logic modules in a config file
* Extend or override default behavior

You can also define **meta-events** to declare relationships, like:

```json
{
  "type": "define_event_type",
  "name": "bookmark",
  "base": "create",
  "logic": "custom/bookmark.js"
}
```

---

### üß© 5. **LLM Integration (Optional)**

LLMs can help users:

* Generate schemas from example events
* Write logic modules by describing behavior in plain text
* Generate summaries or indexes

You could build a CLI assistant for this.

---

### Summary

| Task                        | Strategy                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Declare allowed event types | `manifest.json`, inline `type`, or registry |
| Validate events             | JSON Schema per type                        |
| Process logic               | Modular logic handlers or logic descriptors |
| Extensibility               | Custom schemas + logic modules              |
| Tooling Support             | CLI + optional LLM assistant                |

> When a JSON schema layers definitions with allOf and some properties have two or more title and description, how does most tools behave?

When a JSON Schema uses `allOf` to layer definitions, and **multiple subschemas define the same property** (e.g., a property `foo` appears in two or more subschemas, each with its own `title`, `description`, or other metadata), most tools handle it as follows:

---

### üîç Behavior of Most Tools (Validators & UI Generators)

#### 1. **Validators** (e.g., Ajv, JSON Schema Validator):

* **Ignore titles and descriptions entirely for validation.**
* Only focus on structural and value constraints (`type`, `minimum`, `pattern`, etc.).
* If two subschemas define the same property, they are **merged** as long as the constraints are compatible.
* If constraints are **conflicting**, validation will fail.

#### 2. **UI Generators / Documentation Tools** (e.g., Swagger UI, React JSON Schema Form, Stoplight, Redoc):

* Tend to **merge definitions**, but:

    * If a property like `foo` is defined multiple times with **different `title` or `description`**, the **last one wins**, or:
    * Some tools pick the **first** or **merge them heuristically**, depending on the tool.
    * Some tools may **warn** or **drop all but one** without warning.

### üîß Example

```json
{
  "allOf": [
    {
      "properties": {
        "foo": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Foo Title A",
          "description": "Description from schema A"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "properties": {
        "foo": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Foo Title B",
          "description": "Description from schema B"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### In this case:

* **Ajv** will validate `foo` as a string and ignore `title`/`description`.
* **Documentation tools** may:

    * Use **"Foo Title B"** and **"Description from schema B"**, because it's defined later.
    * Or pick the first occurrence (schema A).
    * Or **combine metadata**, but that's rare.

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practice

To avoid ambiguity:

* **Avoid redefining the same property in multiple `allOf` blocks unless necessary.**
* If you must, **keep `title` and `description` only in one location**, or **use `definitions`/`$ref`** to centralize property schemas.

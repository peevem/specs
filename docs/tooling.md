# PEEVEM Tooling

This document outlines the types of tools that can be built around the PEEVEM ecosystem and provides guidance for developers creating such tools.

## Tool Categories

### Event Generators

Tools that create PEEVEM events from various sources:

- Browser extensions for bookmark/browsing history
- File system watchers
- Calendar integrators
- Email processors
- Manual entry applications
- Smartphone apps for location/activity tracking

### Event Validators

Tools that verify PEEVEM events against schemas:

- Command-line validation tools
- CI/CD pipeline components
- Interactive editors with validation
- Streaming validators for real-time verification

### Event Processors

Tools that manipulate, transform, or analyze PEEVEM events:

- Data filtering and search tools
- Event transformation utilities
- Analytics and visualization tools
- Aggregation services

### Storage Solutions

Various ways to store and manage PEEVEM data:

- Local file-based storage
- Synchronized cloud storage
- Database integrations
- Version control system approaches

### User Interfaces

Interfaces for humans to interact with PEEVEM data:

- Viewers and explorers
- Timeline visualizations
- Form-based editors
- Command-line interfaces
- Mobile applications

## Tool Development Guidelines

### Universal Principles

1. **Schema Compliance**: Always validate against official schemas
2. **Data Integrity**: Never corrupt or modify data unexpectedly
3. **Privacy First**: Respect sensitive personal data with appropriate controls
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle unknown event types sensibly
5. **User Control**: Give users clear visibility and control over their data

### Technical Guidelines

#### Event Generation

- Generate valid UUIDs for events
- Use precise timestamps with timezone information
- Include all required fields for the event type
- Follow schema constraints for field formats

#### Validation

- Use official JSON Schema validation libraries
- Check for schema version compatibility
- Provide clear error messages for validation failures
- Consider partial validation for backward compatibility

#### Storage

- Store NDJSON files with `.ndjson` extension
- Use UTF-8 encoding for all files
- Consider compression for large files
- Implement backup mechanisms

## Example Tool: PEEVEM Validator

A simple validation tool could be implemented like this (pseudocode):

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const Ajv = require('ajv');
const addFormats = require('ajv-formats');

// Setup validator
const ajv = new Ajv();
addFormats(ajv);

// Load schemas
const coreSchema = require('./schemas/core.json');
const bookmarkSchema = require('./schemas/bookmark.json');
// ... load other schemas

// Register schemas
ajv.addSchema(coreSchema);
ajv.addSchema(bookmarkSchema);
// ... register other schemas

// Read and validate events
const validateEvents = (filepath) => {
  const events = fs.readFileSync(filepath, 'utf8')
    .split('\n')
    .filter(line => line.trim())
    .map(line => JSON.parse(line));

  events.forEach((event, index) => {
    // Determine schema to use based on event type
    const schemaId = determineSchema(event);
    const valid = ajv.validate(schemaId, event);

    if (!valid) {
      console.error(`Error in event ${index + 1}:`, ajv.errors);
    }
  });
};
```

## Getting Started with Tool Development

To start developing tools for PEEVEM:

1. Familiarize yourself with the [JSON Schema specification](https://json-schema.org/)
2. Review the PEEVEM schemas in this repository
3. Set up a development environment with JSON Schema validation
4. Create sample PEEVEM events for testing
5. Start with a small, focused tool that serves a specific need

## Contributing Tools

If you develop a tool for PEEVEM:

1. Document it clearly with examples
2. Specify which schema versions it supports
3. Consider open-sourcing it for community benefit
4. Add it to the PEEVEM tools registry (forthcoming)

By following these guidelines, you can create tools that work seamlessly within the PEEVEM ecosystem and provide value to users managing their personal data.

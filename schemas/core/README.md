# Core Schemas

Contains the foundational schema definitions for PEEVEM events.

- `event.json`: The main event schema specification, which you can reference directly in most cases
- `event/properties/`: Should you need to name an event `properties` differently to avoid collision, you may find the property schemas stored
  separately, so it's possible to rebuild events as you see fit.
